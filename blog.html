<h1><h1 style="color:#FFFFFF">My professor is a lazy shit</h1>
<p><p style="color:#FFFFFF">I'm starting semester two of my first year at Fleming, and I got two classes with the same guy. His name is Preet and he is responsible for teaching me Security Risks and Introduction to Networks. The main problem is that he doesn't give too much of a fuck to care about what he's doing or how he treats us.</p>
<p><p style="color:#FFFFFF">The first thing I don't like is how I can barely understand a thing he says. His accent is stronger than the legs of a fatass and it makes it especially difficult when teaching us online with his potato microphone. It might be disrespectful shitting on something he can't control, but if he can understand my normal speaking voice just fine, I expect the same when listening to him. Not only does is he incomprehensible when he speaks, he also rushes through lectures like nobody's business. I can't tell you how many times I poorly understood a lesson because he couldn't care less to explain a bit more about the subject. He only gives a fuck about the big money he gets.</p>
<p><p style="color:#FFFFFF">There is a campus policy where marks MUST be uploaded within two weeks of the deadline, and it's always a big fucking guessing game with Preet. When he isn't stroking his dick to midget porn, he's usually resting on his fatass, delaying any results to our grades. Usually an excuse is given, like "renovating his house" or "taking a while to get to everyone's marks", but getting to everyone's assignments should have been done WEEKS ago. What the fuck was he doing when not preparing assignments for next week? If he has time to make this shit work for two classes, assignments for even just one class can be marked within a two-week deadline. Give me a fucking break.</p>
<p><p style="color:#FFFFFF">Preet is a good example of another teacher taking advantage of online learning, which already is a fucking nightmare because of how much we've gotten used to it. COVID isn't much of an issue, so get your ass back in the classroom. But I guess its for the best, considering he has a short temper. Like some guy accidentally made a sound on his microphone when he left it on during an online class, and Preet straight up threatened to boot him out of the meeting. What the fuck?!? It was a genuine mistake and this is how you act? I'd hate to see his attitude when someone zoombombs the meeting. When, in any circumstance does a small accident warrant a ban from the meeting? Simply put, if you're not in the right mindspace to teach adults, you shouldn't fucking be teaching adults.</p>
<p><p style="color:#FFFFFF">But as I write this, it's only January, and I still have 3 months with this motherfucker. Please end me.</p>
